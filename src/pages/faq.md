# Frequently Asked Questions

## What technologies does this site use?
This site is built with simple, standard web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Content is written in Markdown and converted to HTML on the server. No complex frameworks or build tools are needed.

## How can I create a similar site?
You can create a similar site by:
1. Setting up a basic Node.js server
2. Using Express for routing
3. Writing content in Markdown
4. Using a markdown converter (like `marked`)
5. Applying simple CSS for styling

The source code is available on my GitHub repository.

## Why not use a framework like Next.js or Gatsby?
While these frameworks are powerful, they can be overkill for simple sites. This approach demonstrates that you can build a modern, responsive website with basic web technologies.

Content is written in Markdown files and stored in the project directory. This makes it easy to:
- Write and edit content
- Version control with Git
